For example, the speed adjustment through the slip head, or the simple step-down speed adjustment, etc., the effect was not ideal. According to the speed formula of the three-phase asynchronous motor, the speed n=60*f/p(1-s), where p is the number of pole pairs, s is the slip rate, f is the frequency of the power supply, as long as it can output a controllable frequency AC power supply, the speed of the three-phase asynchronous motor can be changed smoothly, which is the basis of the working principle of the frequency conversion speed regulator.\nThere are many advantages of vector inverters, here we select the four most important ones to describe them in detail.\nOne of the biggest advantages of frequency converter is energy saving. The most obvious industry is the application of fan and water pump industry. Because the power consumption of the fan and water pump is proportional to the cube of the speed, when the external wind/water consumption is not high, the speed will be reduced by frequency conversion, and the energy saving effect will be obvious. The principle of energy saving in other industries is roughly the same, and energy saving is achieved by reducing the motor speed when it does not need to run at full speed.\nIt can be soft-started, saving energy and prolonging the service life When the motor is started directly by power frequency, it will generate 7 to 8 times the rated current of the motor. The increase in current increases the electrical stress of the motor winding and generates heat, thereby reducing the service life of the inverter. And the frequency conversion speed regulation can start at zero speed and zero voltage (it can also be properly increased by torque boost).\nThe control system is simplified The variable frequency controller can start at zero speed and accelerate evenly according to the user’s needs, and its acceleration curve can also be selected (linear acceleration, S-shaped acceleration or automatic acceleration). The operating speed can be adjusted at any time according to the needs, and can be changed rapidly according to the process, and the speed change can also be realized through remote control PLC or other controllers.\nReduce mechanical wear and loss Severe vibration will be generated on the motor or the connected mechanical part shaft or gear when it is started by power frequency. This vibration will further increase mechanical wear and loss, reducing the life of mechanical parts and motors. In the frequency conversion speed regulation, the stop method can be controlled, and there are different stop methods to choose (deceleration stop, free stop, deceleration stop + DC braking), which can reduce the impact on mechanical parts and motors, so that the whole system More reliable, life expectancy will increase accordingly, improve system stability.\nWe welcome global agents, distributors, retailers, and other partners to join us and work together to develop mutually beneficial business relationships.

The core function of a VFD is to convert the fixed-frequency and voltage AC power supplied by the grid into variable frequency and voltage AC power, thereby regulating the operating speed of the motor connected to the VFD. Below are the detailed steps of how a VFD operates:\nRectification Stage: Initially, the VFD converts the input AC power into direct current (DC) through its internal rectifier, typically composed of diodes or thyristors. This process is known as AC to DC conversion.\nIntermediate DC Link: The converted DC flows into the intermediate DC link, which usually contains capacitors to smooth out the fluctuations in DC voltage, providing a stable DC power source.\nInverter Stage: Subsequently, the DC power is fed into the inverter unit. The inverter, utilizing insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) or similar switching devices, converts the DC power into variable frequency AC power. This process is achieved through pulse-width modulation (PWM) technique, where the switching frequency and duty cycle of the switching devices are controlled to generate AC output with different frequencies and amplitudes.\nOutput: The variable frequency AC power obtained after inversion is supplied to the motor, thereby controlling the motor’s operating speed. By adjusting the output frequency, the motor speed can be precisely controlled to meet the requirements of various applications.\nSKF8000 Series High-performance general-purpose vector frequency inverter ","how-to-select-the-appropriate-variable-frequency-drive-based-on-the-load#How to Select the Appropriate Variable Frequency Drive Based on the Load?":"Selecting the appropriate variable frequency drive (VFD) based on the load involves considering several factors:\nLoad Type: Different types of loads have different requirements for VFDs. For example, constant torque loads (such as fans and centrifugal pumps) and constant power loads (such as compressors and conveyors) require different types of VFDs to adapt to their specific operating characteristics.\nLoad Power: The rated power of the VFD should be greater than or equal to the rated power of the load to ensure the VFD can operate properly and have a certain overload capacity.\nLoad Inertia: The inertia of the load affects the selection of the VFD. Loads with high inertia require VFDs with higher power to ensure stable operation.\nStarting Characteristics: The starting characteristics of the load (such as starting torque and starting time) affect the selection of the VFD, and it is necessary to ensure that the VFD has sufficient starting capability.\nEnvironmental Conditions: Consider the environmental conditions in which the load operates, such as temperature and humidity, and select a VFD with suitable environmental adaptation capabilities.\nControl Requirements: Based on the control requirements of the load (such as speed accuracy and response time), select a VFD with corresponding control functions.\nCost Considerations: After considering the above factors, choose the VFD with the best cost-performance ratio, which can meet the load requirements without causing resource waste.\nConsidering these factors comprehensively, you can select the VFD that suits the specific load to ensure stable system operation and achieve optimal performance. It is advisable to consult with professional engineers or suppliers when selecting VFDs to ensure that the chosen VFD can best meet the system requirements.","next#NEXT":"Proceed directly to the following section to begin:\nBuy Now Table of Contents for the Variable Frequency Drive User Manual Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) about Variable Frequency Drives ","the-application-of-variable-frequency-drives-in-the-industrial-manufacturing-sector#The Application of Variable Frequency Drives in the Industrial Manufacturing Sector":"When discussing the industrial manufacturing sector, the application of variable frequency drives (VFDs) is almost ubiquitous.

It has strong pressure regulation ability, rapid and sensitive response, making it superior to traditional PID control frequency-based water supply control in terms of stability, energy efficiency, and other aspects. It also provides better constant pressure and pressure holding effects for sites with pressure tanks. Additionally, the mainboard dual relay directly realizes one-to-three control, or with terminals Y1 and HDO connected to external relays, it can control up to one-to-five water supplies. It has independent pump start and stop pressure and delay control. It can also achieve emergency pump shutdown control when overpressure occurs, by appropriately reducing the emergency pump shutdown delay time (b0-15 pressure upper limit emergency pump shutdown delay). This helps avoid the problem of rapid water pressure rise. Furthermore, the keyboard can directly monitor the set pressure target value or pressure feedback value by toggling the shift key. The monitoring content remains unchanged after power failure and restart.

They can set the inverter’s operating commands, modify or read functional code parameters, and read the inverter’s operational status and fault information, among other functions.\nExplore these documents to learn more.\n8.1 Protocol Content 8.2 Communication Data Address Definition 5.1 Basic Functional Parameters Summary Table Buy Now Frequently Asked Questions about Inverters "},"title":"Chapter 8 ModBus Communication Protocol"},"/en/docs/vfd/modbus-communication-protocol/agreement-content/":{"data":{"":"","#":"The inverter provides an RS485 communication interface and supports the Modbus-RTU communication protocol. Users can achieve centralized control through computers or PLCs using this communication protocol to set inverter operation commands, modify or read function code parameters, and read the inverter’s operating status and fault information.\nThis serial communication protocol defines the content and usage format of the information transmitted in serial communication. It includes the master polling (or broadcasting) format, the encoding method of the master, which includes the function code requesting action, transmission data, and error checking. The response from the slave also follows the same structure, including action confirmation, returning data, and error checking. If the slave encounters an error while receiving information or cannot complete the action requested by the master, it will organize a fault message as a response to the master.\n8.1.1 Application Modes The inverter connects to a “single master multiple slave” PC/PLC control network with an RS485 bus as a communication slave.\n8.1.2 Bus Structure Hardware Interface: Comes with communication interface A+ and B- terminal connectors. Topology: Single master multiple slave system. Each communication device in the network has a unique slave address, with one device serving as the communication master (PC host, PLC, HMI, etc.). The master initiates communication and performs parameter read or write operations on the slaves, while other devices act as communication slaves, responding to inquiries or communication operations from the master regarding themselves. Only one device can send data at a time, with the rest in a receiving state. The slave address is set within the range of 1 to 247, with 0 reserved for broadcast communication. Each slave address in the network must be unique. Communication Transmission Mode: Asynchronous serial, half-duplex transmission. Data in serial asynchronous communication is transmitted in the form of frames, with one frame sent at a time. According to the MODBUS-RTU protocol, when there is no data on the communication data line for a time greater than 3.5 byte transmission time, it indicates the start of a new communication frame. The Modbus communication transmission method The built-in communication protocol of the inverter is the Modbus-RTU slave communication protocol, which can respond to the host’s “queries/commands” or perform corresponding actions based on the host’s “queries/commands,” and communicate data responses. The host can be a personal computer (PC), industrial control equipment, or programmable logic controller (PLC), etc. The host can communicate individually with a specific slave or broadcast messages to all subordinate slaves. For individual access by the host through “queries/commands,” the accessed slave must return a response frame. For broadcast messages sent by the host, slaves do not need to provide responses.\n8.1.3 Communication Data Structure The Modbus protocol defines the format of communication data as shown below. The inverter only supports the reading or writing of Word-type parameters. The corresponding communication read operation command is 0x03, and the write operation command is 0x06. Byte or bit read/write operations are not supported:\nModbus Communication Data Format In theory, the host computer can read several consecutive function codes at once (up to a maximum of 12), but it should be noted that it cannot skip the last function code in this group. Otherwise, an error response will be given.\nModbus Communication Data Format If the slave detects a communication frame error or other reasons leading to unsuccessful read/write operations, it will respond with an error frame.\nModbus Communication Data Format 8.1.4 Frame Field Description Field Description START (Frame Header) Greater than 3.5 character transmission time of idle ADR (Slave Address) Communication address range: 1~247; 0 = broadcast address CMD (Command Code) 03: Read slave parameters; 06: Write slave parameters Function Code Address (High) Internal parameter address of the inverter, represented in hexadecimal; divided into functional and non-functional parameters (such as operating status parameters, operating commands, etc.). See address definition for details. During transmission, the high byte comes first, followed by the low byte Function Code Address (Low) Same as above Function Code Count (High) Number of function codes read in this frame. If 1, it means reading 1 function code. During transmission, the high byte comes first, followed by the low byte. This protocol can only rewrite one function code at a time, and there is no such field. Function Code Count (Low) Same as above Data (High) Response data or specially written data. During transmission, the high byte comes first, followed by the low byte. Data (Low) Same as above CRCCHK (High) Check value: CRC16 checksum value. During transmission, the high byte comes first, followed by the low byte. Refer to the CRC verification section for calculation method. CRCCHK (Low) Same as above END 3.5 character time 8.1.5 CMD Verification Method The verification method is the CRC (Cyclical Redundancy Check) method, using the RTU frame format. The message includes an error detection field based on the CRC method. The CRC field checks the content of the entire message. The CRC field consists of two bytes containing a 16-bit binary value. It is calculated by the transmitting device and added to the message. The receiving device recalculates the CRC of the received message and compares it with the value in the received CRC field. If the two CRC values are not equal, it indicates a transmission error.\nDuring the CRC calculation, the initial value is set to 0xFFFF, and then each consecutive 8-bit byte in the message is processed with the current value in the register. Only the 8-bit data in each character is valid for CRC, while the start bit, stop bit, and parity bit are invalid.\nIn the CRC generation process, each 8-bit character is individually XORed with the register content, and the result is shifted towards the least significant bit (LSB) direction, with the most significant bit (MSB) filled with 0. The LSB is extracted for checking. If the LSB is 1, the register is XORed with a preset value, and if the LSB is 0, no operation is performed. This process is repeated 8 times. After the last bit (8th bit) is completed, the next 8-bit byte is XORed individually with the current value in the register. The final value in the register is the CRC value after all bytes in the message have been processed. When adding CRC to the message, the low byte is added first, followed by the high byte. The CRC function is as follows:\nunsigned int CRC16_CHK(unsigned char *data, unsigned char length) { int j = 0; unsigned int crc Oxffff reg: while(length--) { crc reg *data++: for(j=0:j\u003c8:j++) { if(reg crc 0x01) { reg_crc (reg_crc \u003e 1) 0xa001: } else { reg_crc = reg_crc \u003e\u003e 1; } } } return reg_crc; } 8.1.6 Function Code Parameter Addressing Rules: For reading and writing function code parameters (some function codes cannot be changed and are only used by the manufacturer or for monitoring):\nThe parameter address is represented by the function code group number and label:\nHigh byte: PO~PF (P group) AO-AF (A group) 70~7F (U group) Low byte: 00~FF\nFor example, if you want to access the range of function code P3-12, the access address for the function code is represented as F30CH.\nNote:\nPF group: Parameters cannot be read or changed. U group: Parameters can only be read and cannot be changed. Some parameters cannot be changed when the inverter is in operation; some parameters cannot be changed regardless of the state of the inverter; when changing function code parameters, pay attention to the range, unit, and related instructions of the parameters. Function Code Group Number Communication Access Address Communication Modify RAM Function Code Address P0~PE Group 0xF000~0xFEFF 0x0000~0x0EFF A0~AC Group 0xA000~0xACFF 0x4000~0x4CFF U0 Group 0x7000~0x70FF Read-only, cannot be written Note:\nDue to frequent EEPROM storage, it will reduce the service life of EEPROM. Therefore, for some function codes, no storage is required in communication mode, and only changing the value in RAM is sufficient. If it is a P group parameter, to implement this function, simply change the high byte F of the function code address to 0. If it is an A group parameter, to implement this function, simply change the high byte A of the function code address to 4. Writing to RAM corresponding function code addresses:\nHigh byte: 00~0F (P group) 40~4F (A group) Low byte: 00~FF\nFor example, the function code P3-12 is not stored in EEPROM, the address is represented as 030CH; Function code A0-05 is not stored in EEPROM, the address is represented as 4005H.\nNote: This address representation can only be used for writing to RAM, not for reading actions. When reading, it is an invalid address. For all parameters, you can also use command code 07H to implement this function.\n8.1.7 Shutdown/Running Parameters Section: Parameter Address Parameter Description Parameter Address Parameter Description 1000H Communication setting value (Decimal) -10000-10000 1010H PID setting 1001H Operating frequency 1011H PID feedback 1002H Bus voltage 1012H PLC step 1003H Output voltage 1013H Input pulse frequency, unit 0.01kHz 1004H Output current 1014H Feedback speed, unit 0.1Hz 1005H Output power 1015H Remaining running time 1006H Output torque 1016H All calibration voltage 1007H Operating speed 1017H AI2 calibration voltage 1008H DI input flag 1018H AI3 calibration voltage 1009H DO output flag 1019H Line speed 100AH All voltage 101AH Current power-on time 100BH AI2 voltage 101BH Current running time 100CH AI3 voltage 101CH Input pulse frequency, unit 1Hz 100DH Count value input 101DH Communication setting value 100EH Length value input 101EH Actual feedback speed 100FH Load speed 101FH Main frequency X display 1020H Auxiliary frequency Y display Note:\nThe communication setting value is a percentage of the relative value, where 10000 corresponds to 100.00%, and -10000 corresponds to -100.00%.

The operating environment temperature of the frequency converter should not exceed the allowable temperature range (-10°C to 50°C).\nInstall the frequency converter on the surface of a flame-retardant object with sufficient space around it for heat dissipation. The frequency converter generates a large amount of heat during operation. Use screws to mount it vertically on the mounting bracket.\nInstall it in a place where vibration is minimal. Vibration should not exceed 0.6G. Pay special attention to staying away from equipment such as punches.\nAvoid installation in areas exposed to direct sunlight, moisture, or water droplets.\nAvoid installation in places where there are corrosive, flammable, or explosive gases in the air.\nAvoid installation in places with oil stains, excessive dust, or metal dust.\nFrequency Converter Installation Schematic Diagram Single-unit Installation: When the power of the frequency converter is not greater than 22 kW, consideration of dimension A is optional. When it exceeds 22 kW, A should be greater than 50mm.\nVertical Installation: When installing the frequency converter vertically, please install the depicted heat insulation baffle according to the diagram.\nFrequency Converter Power Installation Dimension A Installation Dimension B ≤15 kW Optional ≥100 mm 18.5 kW – 30 kW ≥50 mm ≥200 mm ≥37 kW ≥50 mm ≥300 mm 3.5.2 Mechanical Installation Considerations Mechanical installation primarily concerns heat dissipation. Therefore, please consider the following points:\nPlease install the frequency converter vertically to facilitate upward heat dissipation. However, do not install it upside down. If there are multiple frequency converters in the cabinet, it is best to install them side by side. In cases where vertical installation is necessary, please refer to the schematic diagram for the installation of the heat insulation baffle.\nFollow the installation schematic diagram to ensure sufficient space for heat dissipation of the frequency converter. However, when arranging the space, consider the heat dissipation of other components inside the cabinet.\nThe installation bracket must be made of flame-retardant material.\nFor applications with metal dust, it is recommended to install the frequency converter outside the heat sink cabinet. In this case, the fully sealed cabinet space should be as large as possible.\"\nNEXT Explore these documents to learn more.\nPurchase high-performance vector frequency drives now.

Users may choose different resistor values and powers based on actual conditions (but the resistance value must not be less than the recommended value in the table, while the power can be greater). The selection of braking resistors needs to be determined based on the power generated by the motor in the actual application system, which is related to the system’s inertia, deceleration time, and the energy of potential load. Customers need to choose based on actual conditions. The larger the system’s inertia, the shorter the required deceleration time, and the more frequent the braking, the greater the power and the smaller the resistance value needed for the braking resistor.\nNEXT Explore these documents to learn more.\nPurchase high-performance vector frequency drives now.

Comprehensive considerations should be made from factors such as matching motors, output voltage, rated output current, etc., to choose a model that meets the requirements and determine the operating mode.\nThe basic principle is that the motor’s rated load current should not exceed the inverter’s rated current. Generally, select the motor capacity specified in the inverter manual, and compare the rated currents of the motor and the inverter. The overload capacity of the inverter is only meaningful during startup and braking. Short-term overloads during operation will cause changes in the load speed. If high speed accuracy is required, consider selecting a model with higher overload capacity.\nFor fan and pump types: Low overload capacity is required because the load torque is proportional to the square of the speed. When running at low speeds, the load is lighter (except for Roots blowers). Since this type of load does not have special requirements for speed accuracy, select the square torque V/F mode.\nConstant torque load: Most loads have constant torque characteristics, but generally do not have high requirements for speed accuracy and dynamic performance. For example, extruders, mixers, conveyors, in-plant transport carts, and crane translation mechanisms. For selection, you can choose the multi-section V/F operating mode.\nThe controlled object has certain dynamic and static index requirements: Such loads generally require relatively stiff mechanical characteristics at low speeds to meet the dynamic and static index requirements of the control system for production processes. For selection, you can choose the SVC control mode.\nThe controlled object has higher dynamic and static index requirements: For occasions with high requirements for speed accuracy and dynamic performance, and for high-precision synchronous control, you can choose the VC control mode. For example, elevators, papermaking, and plastic film processing production lines.\nNEXT Explore these documents to learn more.\nPurchase high-performance vector frequency drives now.
