      <title>What are the functions and advantages of the frequency converter?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/en/blog/what-are-the-functions-and-advantages-of-the-frequency-converter/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 17 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/en/blog/what-are-the-functions-and-advantages-of-the-frequency-converter/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;Before the appearance of frequency converters, it was very troublesome to adjust the speed of asynchronous motors, because the speed and torque were not in a straight line. For example, the speed adjustment through the slip head, or the simple step-down speed adjustment, etc., the effect was not ideal. According to the speed formula of the three-phase asynchronous motor, the speed n=60*f/p(1-s), where p is the number of pole pairs, s is the slip rate, f is the frequency of the power supply, as long as it can output a controllable frequency AC power supply, the speed of the three-phase asynchronous motor can be changed smoothly, which is the basis of the working principle of the frequency conversion speed regulator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many advantages of vector inverters, here we select the four most important ones to describe them in detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of the biggest advantages of frequency converter is energy saving.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most obvious industry is the application of fan and water pump industry. Because the power consumption of the fan and water pump is proportional to the cube of the speed, when the external wind/water consumption is not high, the speed will be reduced by frequency conversion, and the energy saving effect will be obvious. The principle of energy saving in other industries is roughly the same, and energy saving is achieved by reducing the motor speed when it does not need to run at full speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can be soft-started, saving energy and prolonging the service life&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the motor is started directly by power frequency, it will generate 7 to 8 times the rated current of the motor. The increase in current increases the electrical stress of the motor winding and generates heat, thereby reducing the service life of the inverter. And the frequency conversion speed regulation can start at zero speed and zero voltage (it can also be properly increased by torque boost).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The control system is simplified&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The variable frequency controller can start at zero speed and accelerate evenly according to the user&amp;rsquo;s needs, and its acceleration curve can also be selected (linear acceleration, S-shaped acceleration or automatic acceleration). The operating speed can be adjusted at any time according to the needs, and can be changed rapidly according to the process, and the speed change can also be realized through remote control PLC or other controllers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;4&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduce mechanical wear and loss&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Severe vibration will be generated on the motor or the connected mechanical part shaft or gear when it is started by power frequency. This vibration will further increase mechanical wear and loss, reducing the life of mechanical parts and motors. In the frequency conversion speed regulation, the stop method can be controlled, and there are different stop methods to choose (deceleration stop, free stop, deceleration stop + DC braking), which can reduce the impact on mechanical parts and motors, so that the whole system More reliable, life expectancy will increase accordingly, improve system stability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Frequency conversion speed regulation has been recognized as one of the most ideal and promising speed regulation methods. The main purpose of using a general-purpose frequency converter to form a frequency conversion speed regulation transmission system is to meet the needs of improving labor productivity, improving product quality, and improving equipment. The degree of automation, improve the quality of life and improve the living environment and other requirements; the second is to save energy and reduce production costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what are the differences in the benefits of using frequency converters in different occasions? We select the frequency converter according to the process requirements and application occasions and summarize the following points: Frequency conversion speed regulation has been recognized as one of the most ideal and promising speed regulation methods, and the use of general-purpose frequency converters to form the main frequency conversion speed regulation transmission system The purpose, one is to meet the requirements of increasing labor productivity, improving product quality, increasing equipment automation, improving the quality of life and improving the living environment; the other is to save energy and reduce production costs.&lt;/p&gt;
